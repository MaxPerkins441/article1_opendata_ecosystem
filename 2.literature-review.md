# 2.Literature review

The different theoretical models to tackle ecosystem emergence and its governance can be classified into three categories : the normative, the descriptive and the formative models. We show in this literature review that most models are normative and descriptive, while the remaining formative models do not permit to derive practical solutions for ecosystem creators. 

Subsequently, we review the wicked problem literature and demonstrate that ecosystem emergence and its governance should belong to it, while no research has been following this path yet. 

## 2.1 Ecosystem emergence and its governance 

### 2.1.1 Normative models

The concept of normative model originates from psychology and behavioral economics and were used to advise people about how they should make choices \(Johnson and Ratcliff, 2014\). Applied to ecosystems, normative models prescribe how it should behave \(Vicente, 1999\). 

The first normative model of open data ecosystem was sketched by Pollock \(2011\), president of the Open Knowledge Foundation, a non-profit organisation promoting free access to all types of information, data included. He distinguished between open data ecosystems that build on the “one way street” model where data providers publish it out into the world, then intermediaries such as software designers process it and eventually end users consume it. Data goes one way and one way only : from providers to users. He argues that this model is flawed because it considers open data users as passive and that providers are not incentivized to publish high quality data. Rather, he argues that a “proper open data ecosystem” model should be considered, in which feedback loops should exist : intermediaires should publish back the cleaned datasets they designed ; users should report flagging errors back to providers ; providers should take into account the errors and cleaned datasets in order to improve data quality at the source. 

Goëta \(2016\) came upon the same normative distinction by defining two types of systems related to open data. On the one hand, along with Pollock’s one way street schema, open data is considered as a flawed comprehensive initiative restricted to public actors aiming at releasing all the sets of raw data they produced \(Ruppert, 2015 ; Zuiderwijk, 2015\). On the other hand, open data should be about selecting datasets based on their re-usability \(defined as the potential to be used, at least once, after the free access provided by a smart city\). From this approach, open data should be at the center of a dialogue between public entities and other actors playing the role of users \(Denis and Goëta, 2013\). Such dialogue implies interactions, feedback mechanisms and at a deeper level interdependencies between public entities and users, which reinforces the usability of open data sets and strenghten the health of the ecosystem. 

Eventually, based on the study of hackers’ behaviors, Kuk and Davies \(2011\) proposed a scheme, shaped as a waterfall process, embracing all the necessary steps that  both open data providers and open data users should go through in order to start from a dataset and end up with anew service.  


### 2.1.2 Descriptive models

At the other end of the spectrum, we identified descriptive models to represent open data ecosystems. They also originates from psychology and behavioral economics and were used to portray how individual actually make choices \(Johnson and Ratcliff, 2014\). Applied to systems, descriptive models describe how a system actually behaves \(Vicente, 1999\). 

Many heterogeneous descriptive models were used to describe open data ecosystems and its governance. Such as an example, McLeod and Naughton \(2016\) approached Open Data Ecosystem with Actor-Network Theory \(ANT\) and generalised interactions between ecosystem actors as “arrangements”. They decided to describe open data ecosystems “as an actor-network within which data flows are facilitated through an enactment of actors” \(p.28\). 

Boullier \(2016\) and Douay \(2017\) described four different types of urban open data ecosystem and their related governance : the "good old city" type where the data remains in the traditional silos, each data producer remaining the exclusive owner of it ; the “IBM city type” which is a fully piloted ecosystem from a centralization station capturing all data flows ; the "Google city" type  where all the data produced in the urban space are put in relation without presuming any use beforehand ; eventually, the "Wiki city" type where the ecosystem relies on collecting contributions from citizens. A governance where the crowdsourcing place is preponderant to make the decisions concerning the functioning of the ecosystem. 

At last, the framework of knowledge commons \(Hess and Oström, 2007\) was also used to  describe open data ecosystems \(Dawes et al., 2016\). Indeed, open datasets can be considered as knowledge commons due to the license terms under which they are released and because any actor is free to participate in the management of such resource. However, contrary to pure knowledge commons, the governance rules around such resource are not self-managed by a community of users.   


### 2.1.3 Formative models

Formative models are the third kind of models identified in the literature to understand urban open data ecosystem and its governance. They originate from ergonomics where they were used to identify constraints on the types of actions that people accomplish at work in order to develop adapted workplaces \(Choi et al., 2017\). Applied to systems, formative models describe requirements that must be satisfied so that the system could behave in a desired way \(Vicente, 1999\). 

Harrison et al. \(2012\) was, to our knowledge, the first to propose a formative model to incentivize the future emergence of open data ecosystems that could produce value. They consider that three basic and recursive processes are required to fuel the emergence and dynamic of ecosystem : design systems with the intent to create value \(intentionnality\), find ways to keep them financially and politically viable \(value creation\), creation of value and sustainability to influence the design of future systems \(sustainability\). If these 3 processes can help ecosystem creators think about their actions and strategy, they remain relatively abstract and unfit to guide actions as they were orginally conceived as the building blocks of an academic research agenda \(Harrison et al., 2012, p.914\)

Zuiderwijk \(2015\) also created a formative model of platform-driven open data ecosystems aimed at facilitating the use and coordination of open data users. She identified requirements that an ecosystem platform must satisfy in order to accomplish such goals and derive from them 37 design principles that ecosystem creators can apply. Among them we can list the principle of systematically providing homogeneous access to heterogeneous data from various sources or the principle to integrate existing social media into the platform \(Zuiderwijk, 2015, p.139\). Even though this approach is similar to the one choser for this article, Zuiderwijk focused entirely on open data ecosystems where the only users are researchers in social sciences \(Zuiderwijk, 2015, p.1\). Therefore, we can not consider her work’s result as a formative model of urban open data ecosystem emergence, but as a formative model of research open data ecosystems. This creates a gap that this paper intends to bridge by proposing a model from which we can derive design principales to create an urban open data ecosystem and its governance.   


## 2.2 Wicked problem literature 

In this subsection, we aim at reviewing the literature on wicked problems in order to identify their specific characteristic and demonstrate that ecosystem emergence and its governance are intrinsic wicked problems that can not be tackled with traditionnal research methodologies. 

### 2.2.1 Characteristics of wicked problem 

Wicked problems first emerge in the research field that studied general planning and open societal system during the 1950s. Researchers realised that certain open societal issues like poverty, could not be solved by “the classical paradigm of science and engineering” \(Rittel and Weber, 1973, p.160\) that needs to identify a clear set of actors and dimensions to work with. Reducing poverty is a kind of problem where there will never be a clear set of actors to work with because poverty is not a dynamic and evolving concept. Poverty can mean low income, which takes us to the problem of deficient economies or deficiencies in the educational systems. Or poverty could be about deficient health which raise the questions of health services. In a nutshell, wicked problems can not be broken into a definite set of sources that could be tackled one by one. In another words, it is almost impossible to end up with a specific formuation of the problem as “it includes a permanent feedback with its environment” \(Skaburskis, 2008, p.278\) and because the frontiers of the environments in which the problem occurs are evolutive and ill-defined.   


Moreover, what distinguishes wicked problems from traditional research problems is that solutions might trigger consequences that will outweight benefits because of the complex interactions between each part of the problem and its solution. Also, such solutions can not be identified by a single actor as they intrinsically depend on the complementary cognitive skills of actors \(one would not imagine to reduce poverty with a single line of thinking\) and on their social abilities that will permit to bind them together and gather their resources.

### 2.2.2 Ecosystem emergence and its governance : a wicked problem

Among the factors explaining the peculiarity of urban open ecosystems stands the context in which they take place : smart cities. As Dameri \(2017\) puts it, smart city is a “x-city” notion where the “x takes a different meaning based on the dimensions considered of high priority by a territory” \(Silva-Morales, 2017\). Such conceptualization has 2 main implications that conveys toward wicked problems

First, smart city depends on what a territory has considered as high priority, which means that smart city is not a tangible and objective phenomenon but rather the embodiment of an idea of what a city should be or, as Picon \(2013\) puts it, a self-fulfilling ideal. As a consequence, this issue is inextricably, inherently goal-oriented and calls for solutions that will assist cities in reaching their ideal. Here we find one of several characteristics of wicked problems : ill-defined frontiers as a smart city is more a vision than a defined territory ; dependency on the cognitive skills as smart cities rely on the ability to turn a vision into concrete actions.

Karl Popper argues in The logic of scientific discovery that it is a principle of science that solutions to problems are only hypotheses offered for refutation, each refutation being a step toward truth. We can clearly see that our research problem does not fit into this conception of science as its solution will not be hypotheses standing in the quest of truth but a way to improve some characteristics of the cities where people live \(Rittel et Weber, 1973\). 

Second, this conceptualization implies that the research process and the solutions we might sketch will be highly dependent on the smart cities’ stakeholders subjectivity. Depending on the dimensions they claim to be of prime interest, the answers will change. For example, it means that in case of a changing political landscape, the service innovation phenomenon observed might suddenly stop because the new political leaders redefined the  smart city notion and re-allocated the funds for service innovation initiatives. We found here other characteristics of wicked problems : their dependence on the social abilities of humans to gather their resources in organise themselves in a political manner.

Taken together, those 2 points indicates that our research problem is a wicked problem \(Rittel et Weber, 1973\) which calls for a peculiar methodology : the  Design Science Research Methodology \(Hevner and Chatterjee, 2010\). Its peculiarity mainly originates from the fact that the final results include, aside scientific publications, the design of an artifact that can be tested by the practitioners of a field.
