## 4.1 CWA to grasp the static nature of ecosystem governance

### First layer of analysis of the open data work to be governed : the cognitive abilities 

The interviews of urban open data ecosystem members revealed a first layer of analysis of the actions to be taken into account when it comes to building ecosystem governance : the heterogeneous cognitive abilities of ecosystem members. According to [Ipsas and Borman \(2015\)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780080970875), “Cognitive ability is defined as a general mental capability involving reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, complex idea comprehension, and learning from experience”.This concept is generally used to define the “key competences that are needed to meet the challenges of job demands, education, and advanced training, societal expectations, and the demands of everyday life of middle-aged adults” \(Lachman, 2004\)  


The interviews shows different orientations among cognitive abilities of ecosystem members. The first distinction can be made between short-term and long-term cogntive abilities of ecosystem members. According to one civil servant of Grenoble’s metropolis : “On the one hand you have lower-qualified operators that are not asked to have a long-term vision and on the other, you have engineers and highly-qualified profiles that can produce a long-term vision for data production and that, for the ten years to come” \(Respondent \#10\)

The second distinction that we can make is between members with application-oriented members and data-oriented members. Indeed, we have members with cognitive abilities that allow them to deal with software and other that are able to think in terms of data mangement. \(the latter being more adapted to open data work\). As one of Lyon open data’s intermediary put it : “what can we ask in term of open data publication when most of our technicians are used to managing computers and softwares for years and not databases. They do not know what can be considered as normal in terms of data mangement and they don’t have the reflex to gain different skills” \(Respondent \#14\)

Eventually, we can distinguish between technical cognitive abilities to handle the data, and designer cognitive skills that are used to build artefact with data that meet users’ needs and requirements. A clear boundary was observed between those two profiles. One of grenoble’s open data users explained : “our problem is that we do not have the skills to develop the technical part of our projet \(...\) we are more able to tell you what usage can emerge out of the data than get into the data, clean it and reorganise it to make them useful. And that’s a big problem for us today” \(Respondent \#16\)  


### Second layer of analysis of the open data work to be governed : the control tasks of each open data workers

On top of the first level of analysis, the interviews revealed an individual level of analysis focused on the control tasks of open data work. Control tasks can be defined as the tasks that needs to be done, independently of how or by whom \(Vicente, 1999\). Indeed, when actors were asked about their daily activities, they stated some necessary tasks that needed to be done so the production, publication and reuse could be perform successfully. 

For lyon’s open data intermediaries, “the work of the processing and cleaning of the data, before their provision, on the portal is complicated and heavy but necessary" \(Respondent \#15\). As to reusers, they are to spend some time “looking for all the general data sets and and real-time transport data on Grand Lyon’s open data portal, as well as on OpenStreetMap or other portals” \(Respondent \#14\). In Grenoble, “for Open Data portals manager, the most necessary task is to search for the data, whether in other public services or in private data providers’ information system”. 

This second layer of analysis stands at each individual workers’ level. It informs our study about what goals each open data workers must satisfy in certain situation. Therefore, on top of the cognitive level, we add an individual level.   


### Third layer of analysis of the open data work to be governed : the work domains open data workers work on. 

The interviews also showed that open data work takes place into certain technological environments that can be either physical or cyber. The influence of such environments was emphasized by most actors. They experienced how applications, databases or platform could impact the way open data work is conducted. We conceptualize this environments as work domains and the attached layer of analysis as work domain analysis. Work domain can be defined as  “the system being controlled through work, independent of any particular worker, automation, event, task, goal, or interface” while “work domain analysis identifies the structural constraints associated with the equipment and its functional capabilities, showing all of the relevant action

possibilities that align with the work domain purposes” \(Hajdukiewicz and Vicente, 2004, p.529\). 

For example, one manager of the Lyon’s open data program \(Respondent \#2\) indicated : “the evolution of our technological structure \(i.e the open data platform\) should have a limited impact on our relationship with cities that provide us with raw data. It must be stable and adaptable enough to cater with their \(publishing\) needs while assuring some kind of continuity to ease the process on their side”. Another open data intermerdiary in Lyon agreed with the idea that the animation of the open data ecosystem was both limited and enabled by the place in which they organise ecosystem events such as meet-ups of hackathons. This findings may indicate that what needs to be taken into accound when building governance is the work domains in which open data work takes place, for they will limit what the number of possibilities to orchestrate the ecosystem dynamics.    


### Fourth layer of analysis of the open data work to be governed : the ecosystem level  

Eventually, a fourth and last layer of analysis appeared through the interviews and that is the ecosystem level. All interviewees pointed out contextual factors or organisations that structure the open data ecosystem in Lyon or Grenoble. Among them, we can list the political and organizational context, the associations that stimulate and build projets with the ecosystems, the norms and rules that apply to every open data actor, or the standard that shape the data to be opened and reused. This level of analysis is similar to the socio-organizational level of analysis of the CWA that “ describes how actors may be organized into groups or teams, how they may communicate and cooperate with each other, and what authority may govern their cooperation”  


For instance, the association “Open Data France” was mentionned several times \(Respondent \#5, \#8, \#11, \#12\) and considered as a key provider of organizational resources. The open data manager of Grenoble gave great detail about the impact of Open Data France’s activities : “through their campaign called “Open Data Locale”, it is creating tools, training and content that fuel public bodies’ open data initiatives and their intention is to scale up their impact by designating mentors that can act as intermediairies and pass on the resources of Open Data France” \(Respondent \#7\). In terms of political context, one of the data manager in Lyon reminded us how the political context shapes the way open data ecosystems work : “Grand Lyon’s representatives are soon to elected by citizens, which means that there will be a direct relationship between urban population and the metropolis \(...\) Moreover, there is a long political tradition that favors the collaboration with the private sector. And those two factors explain why, today, we keep talking and building projetcs with companies, citizens and the academic community around open data” \(Respondent \#4\)  
  


### The theoretical framework of Cognitive Work Analysis to combine the four layer of analysis of open data work 

Due to the pervasive presence of data in their work contexts, open data stakeholders operate in \(XXX\). In such contexts, it is almost impossible to establish clear work processus that would set the right way of doing Open Data Work. Nonetheless, constraints are needed so open data workers do not break the rules of the ecosystem they operate in. We define constraints as \(XXX\). The governance of constraint-based type of works calls for a cognitive work analysis, that is a “framework of work analysis based on the concept of behavior-shaping constraints and that interogates in a single framework models of worker competencies, workers’s tasks, work domains they evolve in and the ecosystem surrounding them \(Vicente, 1999\).   


Scholars such as Vicente \(1999\) have characterized CWA as \(XXX\). In this type of analysis, the underlying assumption is that \(XXX\). This brigns us to the first characteristic of Cognitive Work, the primary importance given to constraints that the environment imposes on worker’s action. The view point is based on an ecological perspective to human factor \(Flack et al., 1995\) because it gives precedence to the constraints that the work ecology imposes on goal-directed behavior.   


A useful analogy to describe this ecological perspective lies in the ant-beach metaphor \(Simon, AAAA\). A well known example of the ant type of work is the \(XXXX\).   


As stated, the ecological perspective to human factor is not a new concept. Drawing on its initial characteristics, this research extends the notion of this concept by emphasizing what the ecosystem, work domain, individual and cognitive constraints are in open data work and where the flow of interaction occur between the work dimains. From here we define Open Data Work as a data-centric type of work that gives precendence to the constraints that the ecosystem and data spaces imposes on goal-directed behaviors of providers, infomediaires, re-users and beneficiairies of open data. From this definition we derive the 4 main characteristics of Open Data Work : 

* data-centricity
* constraint intensiveness
* multi-dimensioness
* strategic nature. 

## 4.2 Structuration theory to grasp the dynamic nature of governance 

If the last section gave us great insights about the actions that ecosystem governance needs to address, it is insufficient to represent the dynamics of ecosystem governance building \(i.e its emergence and evolution\). That’s why in this section, we move toward the results of the analysis of the data we collected about the evolution of governance building both in Grenoble and Lyon.   


### The two stages of governance building in open data ecosystems

We found out that governance building could be thought of as an iterative two-stage process that stems from the structuration of the information system of the organisation that orchestrate the ecosystem governance.  According to one former civil servant implied in lyon’s open data ecosystem : “governance building is a very iterative process, everybody is lost when it comes to the matter of governance \(...\) And it also depends a lot on the struturation of the organisation’s information system. It depends on this organisation and it impacts a lot on what you can do with data”  


The first stage can be referred to as “governance structuring” and refers to the construction of governance based on the assumptions and knowledge about the world of governance’s designers. According to one representative of Grenoble’s metropolis \(Respondent \#17\), ecosystem governance building need political leaders who draw their actions from a an interpretative scheme and engagement geared toward transparency or mutualisation between public bodies. Those interpretative scheme are the basis on which ecosystem governance is built. Another civil servant in Grenoble \(Respondent \#10\) went into further detail : “Governance needs some kind of validation by the political leaders. In Grenoble there is madame X but in other public bodies, information system executive are not convinced by open data. In Saint-Egreve, the information system executive was sensitive to open data.In my town, the general director service was geared toward mutualisation between public bodies so it was easier to put things in place”  


The second stage can be defined as the “governance-in-practice” stage which is about how human action enacts the structures embedded into governance artefacts, through recurrent interaction with it. It means that ecosystem governance evolves as the artefacts that materialize it are used by ecosystem members. For instance, in Grenoble ecosystem, intermediairies explained to the research team that “governance builds itself through assisting citizens who build projects around open data with the governance tools” \(Respondent \#10\). We can derive from it that ecosystem governance emerges and evolves while being used. Another example was given in Lyon by one designer who animates the ecosystem :  “there were many discussions and the governance process happened in parallel with the building of the open data platform. From a highly technical matter, we switched to more complex issues where a governance was necessary”. From this testimony, we understant that governance building dynamic starts after having set up some structures like an open data platforms or some norms. Perhaps the nature of this second phase is best shown by grenoble’s open data manager in Lyon \(Respondent \#7\) who compared governance building with the organisation of a hackhaton. Both are meant to gather people from many different backgrounds and convince them of participating into the ecosystem dynamic. He went into further detail : “The idea, in order to build a dynamic within the ecosystem, is to attract actors from the entire open data value chain and make them understand why is opening data so useful \(...\) We are creating a common strategy and line of conduct like we would organise a hackathon”  


### The structuration theory as a theoretical framework to define and explain ecosystem governance building process

Drawing on our field study findings, we conceptualize the building of governance as an iterative, two stage process borowed to the extension of structuration theory on technology proposed by Orlikowski \(1992\). The two stages are governance structuring and governance-in-practice.   


Governance structuring refers to the construction of governance based on the assumptions and knowledge about the world of governance designers \(Understanding structure\). The desigers inscribe in artifacts that materialize governance some structures that can we can define as a set of rules and resourcres \(Embedding structure\). Governance structuring relates directly with the process described by Orlikowski which result in structures being embedded within technology \(1992, p. 410\) : “human agents build into technology certain interpretative scheme \(rules reflecting knowledge of the work being governed, certain facilities \(resources to accomplish that work\) and certain norms \(rules that define the organizationally sanctioned way of executing that work\). For open data ecosystem, it is the IS structure that is being embedded.   


Complementary to governance structuring, governance-in-practice refers to how human action \(Applying governance artefacts\) enacts the structures embedded into governance artefacts, through recurrent interaction with it \(Enacting structure\) . Eventually, the recurrent engagement with the governance artefact at hand give birth to a set of rules and resources that are re-constituted from structure, deemed as governance-in-practice \(Iteration on structure\).   


At the end of the day, we can break down the dynamic of governance building into two categories and five subcategories :   


* Governance structuring 
  * Understanding structure
  * Embedding structure
  * Applying governance artefacts
* Governance-in-practice
  * Enacting structure
  * Iteration on structure

## 4.3 Design principles 

Having discussed the characteristics of Open Data Work and governance building dynamics, this section moves toward the synthesis of design principles that respond to these characteristics. As mentionned in section 3.2, synthesizing design principles implies conducting and matching two research activities : building a theoretical framework to understand the system at stake and derive the necessary function is must provide \(cf Section 4.1 and 4.2\) and isolating from field studies the experience and best practices formulated by IS architects. In the following figure, we combine :  

* the design principles 
* the corresponding characteristics of Open Data Work and governance building dynamics they adress 
* the IS architect’s experience they are drawn from.
