## What is an urban open data ecosystem ? 



The environment within which service innovation emerges out of open data is reffered to as urban open data ecosystem. It can generally be defined as all activities for “releasing and publishing \(urban\) data on the internet, \(...\)\(where open data users can conduct activities such as\) searching, finding, evaluating and viewing data and their related licenses \(...\), cleaning, analyzing, enriching, combining, linking and visualizing data and \(...\) interpreting and discussing data and providing feedback to the data providers and other stakeholders \(Zuiderwijk, 2014\). By open urban data, we refer to all open data contained within an urban data space that is a “seamless digital territory on an urban scale that enables the development of new data-based productus and services” \(European commission, 2018\). More precisely, the data at stake are “all kinds of data that may be relevant to the urban community as well as the urban economic and policy space”\(Cuno et al., 2019\)  


## Why should scholars and practitioners care about ecosystem emergence and its governance ? 

The use of the ecosystem metaphor has become widely popular among scolars in information systems when it comes to describe the interactions and interdependencies between data providers, data users and related infrastructures in the cities. Yet, few research efforts were made to develop what Harrison et al. \(2012,p. 922\) identified as “a major dimension of open government research agenda that will drive significant change in the future”, that is “the development of social and material infrastructure for creating \(ecosystems\) along with the governance structures through which innovative architectures, infrastructures and standards will be negotiated for the future” \(Harrison et al., 2012 ; Hassan and Twinomurinzi, 2018\). This paper contributes to this promising line of inquiry in the open government research agenda.  


Indeed, urban open data ecosystem set and provide reusers with a technological, legal and social structure that both constrain and empowers data use. Although these ecosystem features are naturally occuring phenomena, they can also be created, cultivated, managed and driven toward “achieving the managerial and policy vision” of ecosystem creators \(Harrison et al., 2012, p. 907\). In this manner, ecosystem creators can orient service innovation toward different directions, smart city projects and programs being one of them. In this paper, we propose guidelines to assist ecosystem creators in all actions related to the emergence of an open urban data ecosystem and its governance.   


According to Autio and Thomas \(2016\), an ecosystem emerges when ecosystem participants combine their individual offerings into a coherent value proposition. This means that they will bind themselves through technological interpedencies. Moreover, in order to promote and guide the direction of ecosystem toward an objective, ecosystem creators will try to legitimate shared technological assets and standards as well as a platform that will facilitate ecosystem coordination and governance \(Lusch and Nambisan, 2015\). Therefore, this paper contributes to the understanding and knowledge about how ecosystem creators can bind together ecosystem participants and legitimate governance that will serve smart city’s project interest.   


## What are the contributions of this article ? 

### Theoretical and managerial contribution

In the literature, some research stream have been offering theoretical tools to distinguish between different ecosystem emergence and governance type \(Boullier, 2016 ; Douay, 2017\) ; others have been building models to describe how an open data ecosystems actually behave \(Goëta, 2016 ; Denis and Goëta, 2013, Boullier, 2016 ; McLeod and Naughton, 2016\). All in all, these contributions are limited to the description of open data ecosystems and do not offer guidelines to actually create and govern an ecosystem. 

We also identified in the litterature models that prescribe how an open data ecosystem should work \(Pollok, 2011 ; Kuk and Davies, 2011\). This normative stance, while setting a vision of an idealistic open data ecosystem, does not give practicionners a path to be followed in order to reach the vision. 

Eventually, we found contributions were authors built theoretical models that described the requirements that must be satisfied so that creators could drive an open data ecosystem toward a desired objective. The dissertation thesis of Zuiderwijk \(2015\) and the seminal work of Harrrison et al. \(2012\) are among them. Still, the latter gives guidelines to scholars rather than to practitioners while the former focuses on a specific type of open data ecosystems where the only users are social sciences researchers. As a result, there isn’t yet a model or theoretical lens from which we can derive practical solutions for ecosystem creators that intend to build and legitimate some governance that will serve smart city’s project interest. This paper bridges this gap by proposing a model from which we can dervice design principles to create an urban open data ecosystem.    


This model builds itself upon the distinction and combination of a static and a dynamic representation of an urban open data ecosystem. From a static point of view, In this paper we demonstrate how the theoretical framework of the Cognitive Work Analysis \(CWA\) \(Vicente, 1999\) can be of great value to describe and monitor urban open data ecosystems’ emergence. From a dynamic point of view, our results indicate that the structuration theory \(Giddens, 1984\) adapted by Orlikowski \(1992\) to fit technological issues can be of great value to represent the emergence of urban open data ecosystem and its governance. We combine these two theoretical framework to propose a comprehensive theoretic models of urban open data ecosystem and its governance.  


### Methodological contribution

From Hassan and Twinomurinzi \(2018\), we know that for the past 5 years, scholars have been considering ecosystem emergence and governance legitimating as a traditional research problem that called for traditionnal research methodology. Indeed, in the 65 papers reviewed, all of them were using qualitative \(case studies, theoretical papers\) or quantitative methodology \(surveys\). However, we demonstrate that ecosystem emergence and governance legitimating is a different type of research problem that calls for a peculiar research methodology. Churchman \(1967\) and Rittel and Webber \(1973\) refer to as a wicked problem. 

Wicked problems are characterized by the following features :  dynamically complex, ill structured, involving many societal stakeholders with conflicting interests. They call for a peculiar methodology called Design Science Research Methodology \(DSRM\), that, following Hassan and Twinomurinzi \(2018\) hasn’t been used yet in the open data research literature. This paper bridges this gap by using the DSRM to identify design principles that ecosystem creators can use to build and legitimate some governance geared toward smart city projects.   


### Research question and paper structure

In a nutshell, the main question of this paper is : which design principles can support governance building in an urban open data ecosystem ? By design principles we refer to  “normative and directive guidelines, formulated towards taking action by the information system architects” \(Bharosa, 2011, p. 153\), the action being the building of an open data ecosystem governance. The following secondary research question were developed :   


1. To which extent is governance building in an open data ecosystem a wicked problem ? 
2. How can structuration theory and CWA as theoretical framework help tackle the governance building issue ? 
3. Which design principles can support governance building in an open data ecosystem ? 

The paper is structured as follow. The following section first discusses the ecosystem governance literature and demonstrate how it can be affiliated to a wicked problem. Having identified the specific characteristics of the governance building issue, we propose a tailored research approach based on design science. Based on the findings from two case studies, the third section shows how structuration theory and CWA as theoretical framework can be combined and used as a lens to tackle the governance building issue. Eventually, we derive design principles from this theoretical lens that can support governance building in an open data ecosystem. This paper builds on a conference paper that was presented at the 3rd International Symposium of the RGCS network.
