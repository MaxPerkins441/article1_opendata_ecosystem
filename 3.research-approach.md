# 3.Research approach

The Design Science Reseach Methodology \(DSRM\) was developped to tackle the lack of relevance to practice of academic Information System research \(Benbasat and Zmud, 1999\) and aims at building two complementary types of knowledge . On the one hand, it builds conceptual knowledge aiming at describing artefacts surrounding human activity. On the other hand, it provides IS professionnals with practical knowledge that can assist human activity \(Simon, 1969\). Bundled together, these two types of knowledge make what is referred to as Information System Design Theory \(ISDT\) and defined by Gregor and Jones \(2007, p.322\) as follow : “an IS design theory shows the principles inherent in the design of an IS artifact that accomplishes some end, based on knowledge of both IT and human behaviour. The ISDT allows the prescription of guidelines for further artifacts of the same type”  


Following Hevner and Chatterjee \(2010\), DSRM breaks down into five phases \(Figure 1.\)   


| Number and name of the phase | Related research activities |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1-Awareness of problem | Locate a specific lack of knowledge \(SLOK\) in the area of interest that is shared between the research community and the practitioners |
| 2-Suggestion  | Refine the SLOK to one or more research question. |
| 3-Development | Develop an artifact through design and prototyping activities |
| 4-Evaluation | Evaluate prototype impact on practitioners |
| 5-Publication | Write up the results and publish |

Figure 1 : Phases of the DSRM \(adapted from Hevner and Chatterjee, 2010\)  


This article is built upon the development phase of the DSRM \(the remaining phases being developed in the doctoral research from which this article was extracted\) and more precisely on the conduct of design activities. Such design activities are aiming at developing design principles from previous phases and theory and act as input of the following prototyping activities.   


In this article we focus on extracting principles with regard to the ecosystem governance building without explicitely referring to solutions. This do not mean that principles need to be vague. Rather than resulting in an ecosystem governance complete and ready to implement, our suggestion and developement activities will result in principles that purposefully and assertively support architects in a network of actors with designing and use information systems.   


This principles can be defined as ‘normative and directive guidelines, formulated toward taking action by the information system architects” \(Bharosa, 2011, p.153\). They distinguish themselves from requirements and constraints by the way they impact on the design process. 

Requirements are formulated by scholars \(Darke and Shanks, 1996 ; Gibb, 1997\) as “the artifact should be or needs to” statements while constraints are often formulated as “the artifact is allowed or not allowed to” statements. The requirement focus on the individual stakeholders needs while constraints cover the explicit conditions of actions arising from general organisation or context. In contrast, principles draw on the experience of IS architects and their ‘proven practices of the past as well as they draw on the theoretical knowledge related to the design of the system. Whereas requirements and contrains often involve individual systems, principles are included in an IS architecture to ensure that all further developments and improvements adhere to these principles \(Richardson et al., 1990\). To put it in a nutshell, principles capture prescriptive and directive guildelines emerging from knowledge and expert’s experience, that architects can use in the long run to design information systems, whithin the framework of requirements and constraints.   


Extracting design principles implies conducting and matching two research activities : 

1. Building a theoretical framework to represent the system to be designed and derive from it the necessary function it must provide
2. Isolating from field studies the experience and best practices formulated by IS architects

Eventually, design principles emerge once we allocate a necessary function to each issue expressed by the practicionners, visualize the combinations in a table and then make a synthesis of it to extract the main ideas, deemed as principles.   


## 3.1 Building a theoretical framework to represent the system to be designed and derive from it the necessary function it must provide

The construction of this theoretical framework is based on semi-directed interviews conducted in the city of Lyon and Grenoble with actors assuring each function of the urban open data ecosystem : providers, intermediairies and users. Open data providers are responsible for producing raw data and sending data to intermediaires ; intermediairies process, qualify then publish data on open data portals ; users take, analyse and combine open data so to make services out of it. Figure 2. provides information about the actors interviewed in our study. The study focused on these cities both for theoretical and practical reasons. Indeed, Grenoble and Lyon have very different open data ecosystems due to historical reasons and political contexts. Therefore, finding common facts nonetheless the differences was interesting and reinforce the validy of the results. Also, the researcher had access to these fields due to their geographical location, which eased the data collection process.

Figure 2. Characteristics of actors interviewed  


The substantial amount of data gathered was analysed using grounded theory \(Strauss and Corbin, 1990\) that “requires  not only that data and theory be constantly compared and contrasted during data collection and analysis but also that materializing theory drives ongoing data collection” \(Locke, 1996\). That is we analyzed the data collected early on, compared them across observations in order to create theoretical statements. These statements then drove some changes in the interviews protocol so to collect deeper data. In total, the data collection and analysis phases can be categorized into three rounds.   


During the first round of interviews, we asked broad questions about the context, the objectives and the strategy guiding their action within the ecosystem. The main objective was to get a grasp of each actor’s role and function within the ecosystem so to understand who was involved in the governance of open data ecosystems and what exactly was to be governed. After the analysis of the data collected, the concepts of a complex cogntitive tasks method called GOMS Analysis seemed relevant \(van Merrienboër,1997\) to analyse the actions to be governed in an urban open data ecosystems. GOMS Analysis breaks down complex congitive tasks  into 4 concepts : Goal, Operations, Methods and Selection Rules.   


During the secound round of interviews, we asked questions focused on each aspect of the GOMS Analysis : goals to be achieved, cognitive and practical operations conducted, methods at their disposal and the rules they used to choose between the different methods. For instance, open data providers about the different process they could use and the different operations necessary to produce open data. The second round of data analysis revealed the incompatibility of GOMS concepts to analyse actions to be governed in an ecosystem. Indeed, GOMS analysis was conceived to analyse the work that needs to be done at an individual level. That is it uses a individual and normative lens to analyse actions while actors interviewed kept mentionning how organisationnal and contextual factors were influencing their actions. That is the individual lens was inappropriate. Also, they expressed the fact that there was not a good way of providing, publishing or using data yet. That is the normative lens was inappropriate. To go beyond the limits of GOMS Analysis, I turned to another conceptual framework that give primary importance to contextual and environmental factors : the Cognitive Work Analysis \(CWA\). Contrary to GOMS, which uses a cognitivist approach, CWA stems from an ecological approach \(Flack et al., 1995\) and focuses on the environement that both constrain and stimulate human actions.   


The third and last round of interviews consisted of interviews where actors were asked in parallel about the specifics of the daily activities they were conducting, the constraints they were facing at different levels and how the constraints evolved over time. By asking about constraints, we evoked ecosystem governance building with interviewees.  The level of consistency between CWA and ecosystem actor’s experience being satisfactory, every interview was recoded using the concepts of CWA.   


Eventually, the last round of analysis revealed that if the CWA can give us great insight about the actions that ecosystem governance needs to address, it was insufficient to represent the ecosystem governance building \(i.e its emergence and evolution\). In order to bridge the gap, we convoked the structuration theory adapated by Orlikowski \(1992\) to fit technological issue. We found out that the notion of technological structuration could match the data we collected about the evolution of constraints over time. Therefore, we recoded the interviews using the notion of technological structuration and its related concepts. 

We show the results of this data analysis based on grounded theory, explain the different element of the theoretical frameworks we built in section 4.1 and 4.2. We also derive from it the necessary characteristics of an ecosystem governance building process.   


## 3.2 Isolating from field studies the experience and best practices formulated by IS architects

To complete the necessary characteristics of an ecosystem governance building process drawn from theory, we also conducted semi-interviews with three experts that were directly involved in two open data ecosystem governance building processes.
